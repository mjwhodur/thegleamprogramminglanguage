# The Gleam Programming Language

Since the Gleam programming language reached its maturity - and I consider v1.0.0 of the language
as being mature, I decided to write an introductory book to it, just as Kerrigan and Ritchie wrote
their "The C Programming Language" and "The Go Programming Language".

## Why

If you want to learn something, the best way is probably to teach others.

## Why open-source a book?

Because I believe knowledge shall be available freely and to everyone at no cost.

## This book is focused on...
introduction to the Gleam Programming Language, targeting mostly the Erlang VM. 
While browsing the internet, looking for knowledge scattered here and there, I have decided
it is vital to collect all the pieces of the information laying everywhere into one, single
introductory book.

## Plan

- [ ] Initiate the book
- [ ] Expand the articles and sections
- [ ] Cover with as much examples as possible
- [x] Make it free
- [ ] Publish on WikiBooks. 

## Versioning

This book will be semantically-versioned, just like most of the open source software in the world.
It is a little unusual for the book, but I expect it to grow over time. Some of the knowledge here
may become outdated. Some may be unnecessary. I expect the book to grow.

## Authoring

I do not expect to be sole author of this publication. Contributions are welcome.

## Translation

Translators are welcome. As I am Polish, initial work on the book may happen in polish, and those parts
will be translated to English.

## Format
This book is intended to be published in various formats, preferably PDF and EPUB for easy viewing
on multiple devices, as well as being printable. I have decided to go with two formats: LaTeX and Markdown.
I am going to prepare set of tools, that will ease the conversion from MarkDown to LaTeX in not such a distant
future for those who would like to cooperate but lack knowledge of the TeX. But, seriously, it's actually simple :),
I expect the book code to be easy to understand, so authors can focus on writing. It is worth remembering that Markdown
lacks some functionality that LaTeX has.
